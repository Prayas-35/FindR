What is coding?
Coding is the process of using programming languages to give instructions to a computer. These instructions power the websites, software, and applications people use every day.

Why learn to code?
Before diving into your first lesson, I suggest that you think about why you want to code in the first place.

In my opinion, this will help you determine which programming language you learn first, what sorts of projects you want to complete, and ultimately, what you want to make of your skills.

Coding helps build professional skills.
In my journey, I've seen how coding opens doors to numerous opportunities, not just in tech but in various industries. It's a skill that empowers you to create, innovate, and solve problems in new ways.

As technology continues to weave into our daily lives, coding skills will become more desired among candidates — according to job board Indeed.com, several of the most in-demand skills fall under computing.

If you’re looking to make a career pivot into tech or to switch to a more technical role within your field, knowing at least one relevant programming language is a must.

This doesn’t just apply to developers, though. Web designers should know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Project managers should know the inner workings of the tools they help craft.

Even if you run a simple WordPress website, familiarizing yourself with front-end languages and some PHP goes a long way.

Even if you’re not pursuing a strictly technical role, coding experience is an asset. It shows technical know-how, the ability to grasp abstract concepts, and that you can solve complex problems.

Finally, coding knowledge enables you to take up freelance work or a full-time career.

Coding can help you earn more.
The average entry-level salary in the U.S. is $40,153 in 2022. But the average starting salary for a programmer is more than twice as much, at $85,293.

There's no denying the financial advantages of coding skills. The tech industry is known for its lucrative salary packages, and as someone who transitioned into this field, the financial uplift was a significant motivator.

We mentioned earlier that there are differences between coders and programmers. As you continue to learn about coding, you may start to specialize. Many of the highest coding salaries come from the ability to offer your skills in a specific type of coding.

For example, as you continue to code, you may become a developer. Besides writing code, developers also debug software and work with source code. Developers usually specialize in a specific programming language.

Developers often earn higher salaries than programmers and have high projected job growth. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs for developers should grow by 22% by 2030.

Coding lets you create things.
One of the coolest benefits of learning how to code is the ability to bring your ideas to life. Have a concept for a website, app, or computer game? Now, you can build it exactly how you want, then share it with the world.  I still remember the thrill of my first successful program—it was a simple task automation, but it felt like magic.

Whether you want to monetize your project, post it on an open-source platform like GitHub, or just make things as a hobby, you’ll have the knowledge and the tools to do so.

It’s gratifying to know you can build programs that, until now, you’ve never fully understood. Plus, projects are essential to the learning and job-seeking process.

Coding can help you better understand the world around you.
Learning even just the basics of computer programming will help you understand the components of the growing technology landscape.

You’ll gain an entirely new perspective on the technologies in your life and an appreciation for how it all comes together.

Coding is fun.
It’s cheesy but true — for me, learning to code is a rewarding and enjoyable experience. Once I had the basics down and started on my own projects, the process felt less like learning and more like leisure. After all, if you’re not enjoying it, why pursue it as a career?

Thanks to the internet, there’s never been a better time to learn to code. But the sheer volume of options can stall some new coders before they even begin.

1. Figure out why you want to learn to code.
It’s tempting to jump right in when you start coding. But if you don’t have an end goal, you may become frustrated and stop learning before you get to the fun.

So, before you start studying, I want you to think about why you want to know how to code. Think about the projects you want to complete, why this skill excites you, and what resources you have available.

For example, say you want to become a developer to earn more income for your family. Do you know where you want to work and what projects they need developers for? Are you ready to put in the time to learn to code, learn the right programming languages, and build projects that show you have what it takes?

Setting a broad goal like that is important but can be overwhelming. Instead, I suggest that you start with smaller, more specific goals. For example, say you want to build a mobile app for your friend who is training for a half-marathon one year from now.

This goal will:

Help you build the skills you need.
Give you a sense of which programming language to start with.
Set a deadline so you can manage your time while learning.

2. Choose which coding language you want to learn first.
If you’re trying to figure out which programming language to start with, I want you to think about your long-term goals. Are you coding for fun or to advance at work? Do you have a flexible timeline, or do you need to finish a project in a hurry?

When I was in my beginning stages, I started with a language that doesn’t use data structures or algorithms. So, for me, HTML or CSS were great places to start. But languages like Java and Python are also great for beginners, and they have a wide range of applications.

It can sometimes take months to learn a programming language, so take some time to make this decision to make sure that your time is well spent.

3. Take online courses.
Learning to code no longer requires a classroom setting. Today, there are thousands of online programming courses that cover everything from basic HTML to data structures to complex algorithms.

Your first course should introduce the basics of a language and contain interactive modules and assignments to guide your learning.

For me, courses create a structure for learning, which is essential as concepts in computer science build on each other. An organized course keeps everything digestible and ensures you’re learning things in the correct order.

Popular free course providers include:

freeCodeCamp
W3Schools
Scaler Topics
Harvard’s acclaimed Introduction to Computer Science course on edX and the CS50 YouTube channel
These options are great for determining early on whether you’re ready to invest the time to learn a particular language. Plenty of paid courses are available for a fraction of what in-person classes will cost you.

These choices cover a wide range of beginner, intermediate, and advanced CS topics:

Codecademy
Springboard
MIT’s Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python
Some paid services offer free courses or trials if you want to get a feel for their teaching before you commit.

4. Watch video tutorials.
You’ve probably watched a YouTube tutorial or two — why not do the same for coding?

While online courses are your best bet for hands-on experience, online videos can supplement your learning and occupy your curiosity. My personal favorites include:

Crash Course Computer Science
Tom Scott’s The Basics
Both cover broader topics in computing.

5. Read books and ebooks.
Prefer an old-school approach? Pick up a book on your beginner language of choice. Books will introduce you to fundamental concepts and inform your coding.

6. Use tools that make learning to code easier.
While it’s great to know that you don’t need any special tools to write code, there are tools that can help.

Code Editor
Text editors include features to make coding easier like color coding, auto-complete, find-and-replace, and dark mode.

In my experience, most professionals use a code editor. This tool can help you write clean code faster. Code editors are like text editors, but they have extra features that help you manage and edit your code like:
