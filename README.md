**CodeMap.AI** is a web application designed to provide users with technical guidance and support in their coding endeavors. It features **Cody**, an AI assistant built on advanced AI models and a comprehensive knowledge base, to help users learn and advance in various technical domains.

## Who is Cody?

**Cody** is the AI assistant integrated into CodeMap.AI, designed using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to serve as a personalized guide for individuals navigating the complexities of learning and advancing in coding. Cody leverages its vast vectorised knowledge base to provide accurate, context-aware advice across a wide range of technical topics, making it a crucial tool for students at all levels of expertise.

**Why Cody is Important for Students:**

1. **Personalized Learning Pathways**: Cody tailors responses based on the user's queries and conversation history, offering advice that is relevant to the individual’s current level of understanding. This personalized approach helps students focus on the most critical areas for their development, saving time and enhancing the learning experience.

2. **Expert Guidance Across Disciplines**: Cody is trained on a vast knowledge base that includes expert-curated articles and roadmaps across various technical domains, such as web development, machine learning, blockchain, and cybersecurity. This breadth of knowledge allows Cody to guide students through a wide array of subjects, making it easier to explore new areas or deepen understanding in existing ones.

3. **Support for Independent Learning**: For students who may not have access to constant mentorship or resources, Cody acts as a reliable source of expert-level information and guidance. It provides detailed explanations and actionable steps, helping students progress independently and at their own pace.

4. **Contextual Assistance**: Unlike static resources, Cody utilizes conversation history to provide contextually relevant advice. This means that the guidance Cody offers becomes more accurate and aligned with the student’s specific learning journey as interactions continue.
